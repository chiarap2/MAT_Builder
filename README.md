## **MAT-Builder: a System to Build Semantically Enriched Trajectories**
---
The notion of **multiple aspect trajectory** (MAT) has
been recently introduced in the literature to represent movement
data that is heavily semantically enriched with dimensions
(aspects) representing various types of semantic information (e.g.,
stops, moves, weather, traffic, events, and points of interest).
Aspects may be large in number, heterogeneous, or structurally
complex. Although there is a growing volume of literature
addressing the modelling and analysis of multiple aspect tra-
jectories, the community suffers from a general lack of publicly
available datasets. This is due to privacy concerns that make it
difficult to publish such type of data, and to the lack of tools that
are capable of linking raw spatio-temporal data to different types
of semantic contextual data. In this work we aim to address this
last issue by presenting ```MAT-Builder```, a system that not only
supports users during the whole semantic enrichment process,
but also allows the use of a variety of external data sources.
Furthermore, ```MAT-Builder``` has been designed with modularity
and extensibility in mind, thus enabling practitioners to easily add
new functionalities to the system and set up their own semantic
enrichment processes. 

To use ```MAT-Builder``` run ```mat_builder.py```
